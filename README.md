# Result-Analyzer
This application can convert any IGCSE or IB result document sent by the respective boards into an excel spreadsheet. It is used to convert the PDF file into an easily readable and Excel sheet which can then be used to store the data for high-schools that are teaching these boards. 

To use: Download all the files (including the images) into a folder and then run main.py

It was initially made for Jayshree Periwal International School, but now is available for any high school teaching these boards.
